You are to create a short “choose your own adventure story” on a
single page. You are going to use JavaScript to make choices, access
the DOM, and print something out. It should have a title, the story,
and at least the three progressions in the story. Please add images,
colors, fonts, etc. via CSS to set the scene.
Specifics:
1. Use if statements
2. Use variables
3. Use function(s)
4. Use addition or concatenation
5. Have at least three choices in your story
6. Include images, colors, and fonts to your story via external CSS
sheet
7. Each choice should update something in the DOM
Please save your work and upload it to your repository. You will
continue working on this next week.

Please include a readme that discusses your successes, challenges, and
how you overcame them.

Successes:
used onclick to run a js function
updating the story.
ending the story on bad choice or reaching the end.


Challenges:
being creative with a story.
setting up logic for choices.
